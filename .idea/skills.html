    <h3>Piano</h3>
    <p>
        I started playing the piano when I first turned 5 years old. I continued to take lessons until 8th grade where I stopped because I felt held back because of the boring pieces my teacher assigned that I learneed. And while I haven't really played anyhing in awhile, I feel teaching piano is osmething I can do after being taught it for about 8 years.
